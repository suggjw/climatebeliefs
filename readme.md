## Interactive Value-by-alpha map of American Climate Change Beliefs

This map uses opinion estimates from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication to define groups of counties where majorities share similarities in their climate change awareness levels, risk perceptions, and policy support. The exploratory geovisual environment of a self-organizing map is used to compare the support for 56 different climate opinions across all counties in the United States and arrange them into a spatially coherent grid of nodes. To facilitate the exploration of the patterns, a statistical cluster analysis groups together counties with the most similar climate beliefs.A value-by-alpha technique is used to apply increasing levels of transparency to counties with more rural populations - providing visual importance to counties with the largest populations. The result is a picture of the character and geographic distribution of Americans widely varying climate change beliefs.
